	 <h2>What is Hiking and Why do we Love it?</h2>
    <p>Hiking is the preferred term, in the United States and Canada, for a long walk that is taken in rural areas, usually on trails through a natural landscape.</p><p>There are so many reasons to love hiking. It can be great exersice depending on the terrain, pace, and distance traveled. Or it can be a nice way to relax while getting back to nature, there is something meditative about walking in the woods alone. Hiking is a wonderful way to get in touch with nature, especially your local enviornment and ecology. Turn it into a learning experience. There is plenty to learn about flora, fauna, geology, and how it creates ecosystems that can be found in field guides written on a variety of these subjects. </p>
	 <h2>Things to Consider?</h2>

	 <dt>Where Should you Hike?</dt>
	 <dd>While you can hike just about anywhere I'd suggest sticking to public lands to avoid conflicts with private land owners. State forests and state parks are a wonderful resource open to the public. Most have hiking trails open year round though you may want to check in the winter as some trails are converted for cross counrty skiing. Info on you local state parks and forests can be found here <a href="http://www.stateparks.com">www.stateparks.com</a>.</dd>
	 <dt>What should you bring along?</dt>
	 <dd>This depends on several factors including where you are hiking, the weather, and how long you plan to be on the trail. Somethings will always be a good idea to bring like water, a map, a camera, and a cell phone just incase something happens(better to be safe than sorry).</dd>

	 <p><strong>REMEMBER</strong><span class="style">, it is always a good idea to tell someone where you are going and when to expect you back. The best places to hike are also the most remote and infrequently visited.</span></p>
