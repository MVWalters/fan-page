			<h2>What is Hiking and Why do we Love it?</h2>
			<p>Hiking is the preferred term, in the United States and Canada, for a long walk that is taken in rural areas, usually on trails through a natural landscape.</p>
			<p>There are so many reasons to love hiking. It can be great exersice depending on the terrain, pace, and distance traveled. Or it can be a nice way to relax while getting back to nature, there is something meditative about walking in the woods alone. Hiking is a wonderful way to get in touch with nature, especially your local enviornment and ecology. Turn it into a learning experience. There is plenty to learn about flora, fauna, geology, and how it creates ecosystems that can be found in field guides written on a variety of these subjects. </p>
			<h2>Things to Consider</h2>

				<h3>Where Should you Hike?</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>While you can hike just about anywhere I'd suggest sticking to public lands to avoid conflicts with private land owners. State forests and state parks are a wonderful resource open to the public. Most have hiking trails open year round though you may want to check in the winter as some trails are converted for cross counrty skiing. Info on you local state parks and forests can be found here at <span class="hyperlinks"><a href="http://www.stateparks.com">www.stateparks.com</a></span>.</li>
				</ul>
				<br class="clearright">
				<h3>What should you bring along?</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>This depends on several factors including where you are hiking, the weather, and how long you plan to be on the trail. Somethings will always be a good idea to bring like water, a map, a camera, and a cell phone just incase something happens(better to be safe than sorry).</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<h2>Proper Gear</h2>
			<h4>When hitting the trail, what should you wear?</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>Proper footware for the weather and enviornment is a must. Know what the terrain is like, Should you wear boots or shoes?Is it going to be wet? Perhaps waterproof footware would better.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Wearing pants or shorts may seem like a weather related question but it is much more. Depending on time of year you may be dealing with insects or poisonous plants. Terrain plays a part as you may want long pants for scrambling on rocks or walking through dense forest, but may want shorts if you are walking through fields or on well groomed trails.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Head wear can be nice. A hat with a brim to keep the sun out of your eyes or off your neck, rain out of your face, or maybe just to keep your hair from getting snagged on branches is something i'd recommend. A bandana or sweat band can be nice on a hot day to divert sweat out of your eyes while hiking.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Respect Nature</h2>
			<p id="litter">Any time you are enjoying the natural world around you remember that it's up to us to keep it this way. Anything you bring with you should be brought back out. It is a shame to see litter in the forest miles from the nearest road but it happens everywhere. Bring a plastic bag for your trash to carry it to a proper trash receptical. Try to only bring reusable containres for water or snacks.</p>
			<br>
			<p style="background-color:#ffcc00"><span class="bold">REMEMBER</span><span class="style">, it is always a good idea to tell someone where you are going and when to expect you back. The best places to hike are also the most remote and infrequently visited.</span></p>
